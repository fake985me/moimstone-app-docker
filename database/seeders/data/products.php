This has a great cost-saving advantage because there is no need to install a power outlet for each individual device. The D2624GP provides 24 fixed 10/100/1000BASE-T (RJ-45) gigabit Ethernet service ports. It also provides four 1000BASE-X (SFP) / 10GBASE-R (SFP+) uplink ports, making it an efficient switch that can be utilized in various network environments. D2624GP provides intelligent services such as QoS, security ACL (Access Control List), and multicast management to ensure stable network communication and build a high-performance network. In addition, it has a wide range of performance, reliability, and enhanced network management functions to enable efficient network construction and differentiated service provision.',
